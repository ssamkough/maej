# Make an App Everyday Journey üó∫Ô∏è

The "Make an App Everyday Journey" was a personal challenge to create an Android app everyday. This helped me gain more experience in Android programming, and getting in the habit of coding every day. This journey started on January 13, 2016 and ended on April 22, 2016. I've combined all of these apps into one repository.

I have a website that showcases all the apps with their icons [samkoughmaej.weebly.com](https://samkoughmaej.weebly.com/).
